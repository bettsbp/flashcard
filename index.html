          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p class="definition">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p class="definition">JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function.</p>

        <div class="card thumbnail">
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p class="definition">A method is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</p>
