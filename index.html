          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p class="definition">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages.

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p class="definition">JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function.</p>
